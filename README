ABOUT

Smatter is a small visual exploratory data analysis (VEDA)  tool. It's primary
mode of visualization is the scatter-plot matrix. A scatter plot matrix, or 
scatter matrix is a N x N display of scatter plots, where N is the number of 
variables being examined. In each cell (i,j) of the matrix, the plot displays 
a chart of of i versus j. In the main diagonal the name of each variable is 
shown.

Smatter is designed to allow very quick inspection of possibly very large data
sets. While development is not yet complete, the goal is to support files much
larger than available RAM in the machine. In VEDA it is essential to take a 
new data set and quickly get a sense of what is going on. As such, the primary
motivation for designing to tool is to remove all barriers from exploring new
and large data sets. We try to acheive this with an uncluttered display and
navigating the system primarily though keyboard short-cuts.

THANKS

The CSV parsing routines come from libmba-0.9.1 - Thanks Michael B Allen!

USAGE

Smatter reads data from well formed CSV files and is invoked from the command
line simply as:

	smatter path/to/data.csv

From here we enter a land of keyboard shortcuts.
